# Ludo

This end-to-end web application is implemented using asynchronous and event-driven socket programming in JavaScript to emulate the experience of the Ludo board game. Several JavaScript and ES-6 concepts, like callbacks, promises, closures and async-await are used as well

NodeJS is used on the back-end to create HTTP server, read and serve files asynchronously, create web sockets with clients and configure server-side routes

ReactJS, on the other hand, has been used on the front-end for extensive state management of several React components. Moreover, the in-browser web socket API is also accessed through ReactJS for client-side socket programming

The project was implemented in a total of 4 days. It is not yet deployed anywhere. However, source code can be downloaded from here and can be run locally on port 64000 for running NodeJS server and port 63000 for configuring server-side of the sockets
